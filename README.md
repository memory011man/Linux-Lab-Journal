# Linux Lab Journal

This repo documents my progress learning Linux and cybersecurity tools in a safe, virtualized lab.  
It includes daily logs, commands, and screenshots to demonstrate applied practice.  

## Contents
- `week1/` → Ubuntu setup, nmap basics
- `week2/` → Wireshark captures
- `week3/` → Password cracking demos
- `week4/` → Metasploit exercises

## Notes
All experiments are conducted on isolated VMs that I own.
